TEE(1) "fases core"

# NAME

tee - duplicate standard input

# SYNOPSIS

*tee* [*-ai*] [*file...*]

# DESCRIPTION

Duplicate standard input. By default, with no options or files specified, tee 
acts just like cat; it copies standard input to standard output. With files 
specified, tee not only copies standard input to standard output, but it also 
copies it to the files specified by the user.

*-a*
	Append the output to the files instead of overriding them.

*-i*
	Ignore the SIGINT signal, which is triggered by <Ctrl> + <C> on the keyboard.

# EXAMPLES

*cat file.txt | tee one.txt two.txt three.txt four.txt five.txt*
	Copy cat's output to the files one.txt, two.txt, three.txt, four.txt,
	five.txt.
