CMP(1) "fases core"

# NAME

cmp - compare two files

# SYNOPSIS

*cmp* [*-l*|*-s*] *file1* *file2*

# DESCRIPTION

Compare two files. If the files are identical, *cmp* doesn't write anything 
to standard output and returns 0. Else, with no options, it writes to 
standard output the byte and line number at which it found the first 
difference and returns 1.

*-l*
	Write the byte number and the differing bytes for each difference in 
	decimal and octal respectively.

*-s*
	Write nothing to standard output or standard error when the files 
	differ. Only write diagnostic messages to standard error.

# EXAMPLES

*cmp -s foo.txt bar.txt*
	Compare foo.txt to bar.txt and return 1 if the files are different.
